# body_performance
In this project, we analyzed a dataset called BodyPerformance in short, which is the 
Body Performance of Korean athletes Data Set. In this dataset, various performance 
types such as grip force, sit and bend forward, sit up count, and broad jump given 
with age, gender, height, weight, body fat, diastolic and systolic values can be said 
that influence the performance of Korean athletes. These variables are analyzed to 
understand if there exists a pattern at all. These traits are then analyzed to find a 
statistical significance of body performance with different statistical metrics and 
perspectives, such as Comparison of means, proportions, linearity testing, the mean 
significance by z-test, linear regression, and variance analysis. Results indicate that
there are some significant dependencies between body performance and body 
measurements
